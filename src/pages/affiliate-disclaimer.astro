      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Affiliate Relationships</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        PickMyAITools is a participant in various affiliate marketing programs. This means we may earn commissions when you click on links to products or services and make a purchase. These commissions help us maintain and improve our website while keeping our content free for readers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Editorial Independence</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Our affiliate relationships do not influence our editorial content. We only recommend products and services that we believe will provide value to our readers, regardless of whether we have an affiliate relationship with them.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Transparency</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We clearly mark affiliate links throughout our content. All affiliate links include appropriate attributes (rel="nofollow sponsored") and open in new windows. You can identify affiliate links by:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Links that open in new windows</li>
        <li>Links that include tracking parameters</li>
        <li>Clear disclosure statements on relevant pages</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">No Additional Cost to You</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Using our affiliate links does not increase the price you pay for products or services. The commission we earn comes from the merchant, not from you.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Your Support</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        When you use our affiliate links, you're supporting our work and helping us continue to provide free, valuable content. We appreciate your support!
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Questions</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
